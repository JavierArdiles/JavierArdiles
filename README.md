I´m a full stack developer 💻 eager to learn new technologies 🤓, get knocked down with problems 🥊 and get back up again to solve them 💪.
I´ve recently finished the Henry Bootcamp 🥾 where I learned all you need to know to get started in the web development industry: 🔧

One of the final projects of the bootcamp consisted in making a web page in which the user can find, sort, filter and create existing or fictional dog breeds. Check it out here --> [Dog App](https://github.com/JavierArdiles/PI-Dogs-FT16a) 🐶

I studied civil engineering for two years at the University of Buenos Aires and never thought I´d be so passionate about programming. Until one day I stumbled upon a simple 20 hour course on introduction to programming, and haven´t stopped learning since then.
Now I can´t picture myself doing anything else for a living. Do what you´re passionate about and you´ll never work a day in your life!!!

I´m currently working at [Amalgama](https://amalgama.co/) as a WordPress developer and have recently gone back to university to study computer engineering.

Fun facts about me: I love rowing 🚣‍♀️, music (I play piano 🎹, sax 🎷 and guitar 🎸) and photogrphy 📷.

I´m a full stack developer 💻 eager to learn new technologies 🤓 and get knocked down 🥊 with problems to solve and get back up again 💪.
I´m currently finishing the Henry Bootcamp 🥾 where I learned all you need to know to get started in the web development industry: 🔧
- JavaScript ![javascript](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Flogodix.com%2Flogo%2F374972.png&f=1&nofb=1 =10x10)
- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- React, Redux
- Node, Express
- SQL, Sequelize

I´ve recently finished one of the final projects of the bootcamp. Check it out here --> [Dog App](https://github.com/JavierArdiles/PI-Dogs-FT16a) 🐶

I never thought I would be so passionate about programming until I stumbled upon a simple 20 hour course on introduction to programming.
Now I can´t picture myself doing anything else for a living. Do what you´re passionate about and you´ll never work a day in your life!!!

Fun facts about me: I love rowing 🚣‍♀️, music (I play piano 🎹, sax 🎷 and guitar 🎸) and photogrphy 📷.

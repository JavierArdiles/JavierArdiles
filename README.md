I´ve recently finished one of the final projects of the bootcamp. Check it out here --> [Dog App](https://github.com/JavierArdiles/PI-Dogs-FT16a) 🐶

I never thought I would be so passionate about programming until I stumbled upon a simple 20 hour course on introduction to programming.
Now I can´t picture myself doing anything else for a living. Do what you´re passionate about and you´ll never work a day in your life!!!

Fun facts about me: I love rowing 🚣‍♀️, music (I play piano 🎹, sax 🎷 and guitar 🎸) and photogrphy 📷.
